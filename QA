What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Music Player

In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project a web-based synthesizer.")
My project is a desktop-based music player built with PyQt5, allowing users to play, pause, skip tracks, and manage playlists.

List at least 3 resources you know you will use in developing your project
1. PyQt5 Documentation – For GUI development and event handling.  
2. Python `mutagen` Library – For reading MP3 metadata (artist, album, etc.).  
3. Qt Multimedia Classes – For audio playback functionality.

In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
The software will be a functional music player with a clean, user-friendly interface. Key features include:  
- Basic playback controls (play, pause, stop, next, previous).  
- Volume adjustment and progress bar.  
- Playlist management (add, remove, shuffle).  
- Display of song metadata (title, artist, album art if possible).  
- A responsive UI with themes (light/dark mode).  
The player will be built entirely in Python using PyQt5 for the GUI and Qt’s multimedia backend for audio handling.

Will any work as part of this project overlap with any work you are doing outside of this class? For another class? Who is the professor in this class?
No, this project is solely for this class.

In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
GOOD Outcome (Minimum Viable Product):
- Functional playback controls (play/pause/stop).  
- Basic playlist loading.  
- Volume control.

In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
- Progress bar & seek functionality.  
- Metadata display (song title, artist).  
- Playlist management (add/remove tracks).

In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
- Album art display.  
- Custom themes (light/dark mode).  
- Keyboard shortcuts for controls.

In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps WITH A SPECIFIC CALENDAR. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
Week 1 (Research & Setup):  
- Study PyQt5 widgets and QtMultimedia.  
- Set up a basic window with buttons.  

Week 2 (Core Functionality):  
- Implement audio playback using `QMediaPlayer`.  
- Add playlist support with `QMediaPlaylist`.  

Week 3 (UI Enhancements):  
- Design a progress bar and volume slider.  
- Display metadata using `mutagen`.  

Week 4 (Polishing & Extras):  
- Add theme support (QSS styling).  
- Test and debug for smooth performance.  

By following this plan, I aim to deliver at least a GOOD outcome, with room for BETTER or even BEST if time permits.
