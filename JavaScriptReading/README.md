### Chapter 1: Values, Types, and Operators
- **What I Knew**: I already knew that JavaScript has primitive data types such as numbers, strings, and booleans. In programming, understanding these basic building - blocks is fundamental for any operation. For example, when creating a simple calculator application, numbers are used for arithmetic operations, and strings are used to display results or take user input.
- **What I Didn't Know**: I didn't know about the existence and behavior of the special values "null" and "undefined" in JavaScript. "Null" is an intentionally empty value, while "undefined" usually indicates that a variable has been declared but not assigned a value, or a function has no return value. This distinction is crucial when handling data, and I was unaware of its nuances before reading this chapter.

### Chapter 2: Program Structure
- **What I Knew**: I was familiar with the concept of control flow statements like "if - else" in programming. They are used to make decisions in a program based on certain conditions. For instance, in a login system, an "if - else" statement can be used to check if the entered username and password are correct.
- **What I Didn't Know**: I didn't know about the short - circuit behavior of logical operators in JavaScript. For example, in the expression "A && B", if "A" is false, "B" won't be evaluated because the whole expression will be false regardless. This can be used for performance optimization and writing more concise code.

### Chapter 3: Functions
- **What I Knew**: I knew that functions are reusable blocks of code that can take inputs (parameters) and return outputs. In many programming languages, functions are used to modularize code and make it more organized. For example, a function can be created to calculate the area of a circle.
- **What I Didn't Know**: I didn't know about closures in JavaScript. A closure is a function that has access to its outer function's scope even after the outer function has finished executing. This concept allows for some very powerful programming patterns, such as creating private variables and functions.

### Chapter 4: Data Structures: Objects and Arrays
- **What I Knew**: I was aware that arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, and objects are used to store key - value pairs. Arrays are useful for storing lists of data, like a list of names, and objects can represent more complex data structures, like a person with properties such as name, age, and address.
- **What I Didn't Know**: I didn't know about the method chaining capabilities with array methods in JavaScript. For example, you can chain methods like "map", "filter", and "reduce" together to perform complex data transformations in a single, concise statement.

### Chapter 5: Higher - Order Functions
- **What I Knew**: I knew that functions in JavaScript can be passed as arguments to other functions. This is a common practice in functional programming, where functions are treated as first - class citizens. For example, the "forEach" method on arrays takes a function as an argument to perform an action on each element.
- **What I Didn't Know**: I didn't know about the concept of currying in JavaScript. Currying is the process of converting a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each take a single argument. This can make functions more flexible and reusable.

### Chapter 6: The Secret Life of Objects
- **What I Knew**: I knew about object - oriented programming concepts like classes and inheritance in general programming. Classes are used to define blueprints for creating objects, and inheritance allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another class.
- **What I Didn't Know**: I didn't know about the prototype - based inheritance in JavaScript. Unlike class - based inheritance in some languages, JavaScript uses prototypes, where objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects directly. This provides a more flexible and dynamic way of creating object hierarchies.
